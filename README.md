# Perfect vector macOS cursors

[![Preview](https://github.com/e1ectron/macOS-vector-cursors/raw/master/preview.jpg)](https://github.com/e1ectron/macOS-vector-cursors/releases/latest)

I start this project, because all we use cursors for our projects, to show some objects in action (on hover, drag etc.). But I not found cursors, which completely match with native macOS and has a good quality shapes.

You can [download cursors in various formats](https://github.com/e1ectron/macOS-vector-cursors/releases/latest)
Or add it as [Sketch Library](https://www.sketch.com/s/cf1b84b5-bcff-4856-8ca1-4d7966ef4b95/symbols) and [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/944525938717051670)

In this pack all cursors already has shadows. If you need it without shadows â€” just update shadow styles in Sketch file and export it. Or you can use svg from IconJar folder (it not support shadows in SVG).

Cursors was built in Sketch with symbols support

In next I plan to add PS and AI formats or create Adobe Library with cursors.

**Any help are welcome**
